# What is DevSecOps

DevSecOps is an approach to software development that integrates security into the entire software development lifecycle. It combines the principles of DevOps with security to create a culture of security that permeates the entire development process.

The goal of DevSecOps is to ensure that security is not an afterthought but is built into the development process from the very beginning. This approach emphasizes collaboration between development, operations, and security teams to ensure that security is a shared responsibility across the organization.

DevSecOps involves the implementation of security controls throughout the development lifecycle, from design to deployment, and beyond. This includes automated security testing, continuous monitoring, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing.

By implementing DevSecOps practices, organizations can improve their overall security posture and reduce the risk of security breaches and vulnerabilities. This approach also helps to accelerate the delivery of secure software by integrating security into the development process, rather than treating it as a separate activity.
